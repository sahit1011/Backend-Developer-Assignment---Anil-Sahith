Assignment
Wayne Enterprises is a fictional company appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics, commonly in association with the superhero Batman. Wayne Enterprises is a large, growing multinational company. Your role is to quickly develop a business intelligence dashboard that showcases key insights from company data through a FastAPI backend and Next.js frontend. This is a 5-hour challenge designed to demonstrate your ability to rapidly prototype full-stack applications while creating meaningful data visualizations and professional business presentations.
Your task is to build a single-page dashboard application with a FastAPI backend that processes 2-3 sample datasets (focusing on financial data, HR metrics, and basic operations) and a Next.js frontend that displays the insights through interactive charts and visualizations. The backend should provide essential API endpoints for dashboard data and perform basic analytics calculations, while the frontend should feature an executive summary section with key metrics cards, 4-6 essential charts showing revenue trends, department performance, and employee distribution, plus one compelling data narrative presented in newspaper style with a clear headline and supporting visualization. Use libraries like Chart.js or Recharts for rapid chart development and Tailwind CSS for clean, professional styling.
Focus on core functionality over advanced features, prioritizing clear data presentation and professional appearance suitable for executive use. The time allocation should be roughly 2 hours for backend development (project setup, data processing, and API endpoints) and 3 hours for frontend development (dashboard layout, chart implementation, and final styling). Use mock data if dataset processing becomes too complex, and leverage create-next-app and FastAPI's automatic documentation for rapid development setup.
The final deliverable should be a working proof-of-concept that demonstrates your full-stack development skills, data visualization capabilities, and ability to present business insights professionally under time constraints. Success will be measured by functionality (all components work correctly), visual appeal (professional appearance suitable for Wayne Enterprises' CEO), clear communication of business insights, and proper technical implementation with separated backend and frontend concerns. Remember to prioritize completion over perfection - a working simple dashboard that tells a clear business story is better than an incomplete complex system.
