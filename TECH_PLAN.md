# Technical Implementation Plan

## 1. Project Setup

### 1.1. Backend (FastAPI)
- [ ] Initialize a new FastAPI project (virtual environment, requirements.txt, main.py).
- [ ] Add CORS middleware to allow frontend requests.
- [ ] Set up folder structure: `app/`, `app/api/`, `app/models/`, `app/services/`, `data/`.

### 1.2. Frontend (Next.js)
- [ ] Bootstrap a new Next.js app using `create-next-app`.
- [ ] Install dependencies: Tailwind CSS, Chart.js or Recharts, Axios.
- [ ] Set up folder structure: `components/`, `pages/`, `services/`, `styles/`.

---

## 2. Data Preparation

- [ ] Review provided CSV datasets.
- [ ] Select 2-3 datasets (e.g., Financial, HR, and one more).
- [ ] Write Python scripts to load and preprocess these datasets (handle missing values, parse dates, etc.).
- [ ] Store cleaned data in memory or as JSON for rapid prototyping.

---

## 3. Backend API Development

- [ ] Design API endpoints for:
  - [ ] Executive summary metrics (e.g., revenue, retention, satisfaction).
  - [ ] Chart data (e.g., revenue trends, department performance, employee distribution).
  - [ ] Data narrative (headline + supporting data).
- [ ] Implement endpoints in FastAPI.
- [ ] Add basic analytics calculations (e.g., aggregations, trends).
- [ ] Test endpoints with sample requests (using Swagger UI or Postman).

---

## 4. Frontend Dashboard Development

- [ ] Design dashboard layout (header, summary cards, charts, narrative section).
- [ ] Implement executive summary cards (fetch from API).
- [ ] Implement 4-6 charts using Chart.js or Recharts (fetch data from API).
- [ ] Create a "newspaper style" narrative section with headline and visualization.
- [ ] Apply Tailwind CSS for professional styling and responsive design.

---

## 5. Integration & Testing

- [ ] Connect frontend to backend API using Axios.
- [ ] Test data flow end-to-end (API to UI).
- [ ] Validate all charts and metrics display correctly.
- [ ] Ensure error handling for failed API requests.

---

## 6. Finalization & Submission

- [ ] Polish UI for executive-level presentation.
- [ ] Record a screen capture demo of the app.
- [ ] Push code to GitHub.
- [ ] Share GitHub repo and video link as per instructions.

---

## Optional (if time permits)
- [ ] Add loading spinners and error messages.
- [ ] Add unit tests for backend endpoints.
- [ ] Add comments and documentation.
